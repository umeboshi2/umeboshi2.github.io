        text: The Journal of Theoretical Biology and its co-Chief Editors do
         not endorse in any way the ideology of nor reasoning behind the
         concept of intelligent design. Since the publication of the paper it
         has now become evident that the authors are connected to a creationist
         group (although their addresses are given on the paper as departments
         in bona fide universities). We were una-ware of this fact while the
         paper was being reviewed. Moreover, the keywords ‘‘intelligent design”
         were added by the authors after the review process during the
         proofing stage and we were unaware of this action by the authors.
         We have removed these from the online version of this paper. We
         believe that intelligent design is not in any way a suitable topic
         for the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
