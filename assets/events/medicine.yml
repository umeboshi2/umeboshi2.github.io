    pretext: Unlike previous epidemics, in addressing COVID-19 nearly all
     international health organizations and national health ministries have
     treated a single positive result from a PCR-based test as confirmation of
     infection, even in asymptomatic persons without any history of exposure.
     This is based on a widespread belief that positive results in these tests
     are highly reliable. However, data on PCR-based tests for similar viruses
     show that PCR-based testing produces enough false positive results to make
     positive results highly unreliable over a broad range of real-world
     scenarios. This has clinical and case management implications, and affects
     an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio,
     prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates. Steps should be taken to
     raise awareness of false positives, reduce their frequency, and mitigate
     their effects. In the interim, positive results in asymptomatic individuals
     that haven't been confirmed by a second test should be considered suspect.
