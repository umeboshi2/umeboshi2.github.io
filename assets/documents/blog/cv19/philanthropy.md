# [Philanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy)

[Philanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy)
"consists of 'private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality 
of life'. Philanthropy contrasts with business initiatives, which are private 
initiatives for private good, focusing on material gain, and with government 
endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on 
provision of public services. A person who practices philanthropy is a 
philanthropist.

Philanthropy is different from charity, though there is some overlap. Charity 
aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem, whereas philanthropy 
attempts to address the root cause of the problem."


## Philanthropy and Charity

Please note that the Wikipedia authors assign charity as the mere treatment 
of symptoms, yet elevate philanthropy above charity by describing the works 
as addressing the root of the problem.

"I’m reminded, sadly, of the invidious distinction we sometimes make between 
charity and philanthropy.  By some accounts, charity represents a kind of weak, 
emotional response while philanthropy gets to the root of a problem and solves 
it once and for all.

Views like this are fairly common in our field, but we need to shed them and 
approach, with fear and trembling, the divinity that illuminates the great acts 
of self-sacrifice Nazario describes.  We can extol the virtues of strategic 
philanthropy, when practiced well, without also deprecating the acts of 
goodness that define, in my view, what it means to be fully human."

Another article helps to clarify the difference:
"Charity has been described as something we, as Americans, experience regularly 
in our culture. Early on in elementary school, we are taught to be generous and 
to share. In religious and moral settings, we are taught to think of our 
neighbor in their times of need. From change jars at registers with causes 
written on the front to food drives during the holiday season, we are called on 
to be charitable to our neighbor down the street, to even our global neighbor, 
on a daily basis.

By that definition, acts of charity all sound great – what could philanthropy 
possibly have on charity? Steve Gunderson, former President and CEO of the 
Council of Foundations, described the nuanced difference between charity and 
philanthropy as this:

'Charity tends to be a short-term, emotional, immediate response, focused 
primarily on rescue and relief, whereas philanthropy is much more long-term, 
more strategic, focused on rebuilding. One of my colleagues says there is 
charity, which is good, and then there is problem-solving charity, which is 
called philanthropy, and I think that’s the distinction I have tried to make.'

Philanthropy, then, is the preferred method because it not only seeks to help, 
but intentionally searches for the root of the problem and looks for solutions. 
It is great to offer food, shelter, and clothing to someone without a home. But 
how much better would it be to provide solutions to the problems such as 
hosting a job fair or funding an abuse clinic. Don’t get me wrong: charity, 
meeting the immediate human needs of your fellow human, is good and necessary 
in our world today. However, it’s important to keep in mind the words of a man 
known for his philanthropic actions, John Rockefeller, 'The best philanthropy 
is constantly in search of the finalities—a search for a cause, an attempt to 
cure evils at their source.'”

## The Philanthropist

"A philanthropist is someone who engages in philanthropy; donating his or her 
time, money, and/or reputation to charitable causes. The term may apply to any 
volunteer or to anyone who makes a donation, but the label is most often 
applied to those who donate large sums of money or who make a major impact 
through their volunteering, such as a trustee who manages a philanthropic 
organization or one who establishes and funds a foundation."
