# [Philanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy)

[Philanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy)
"consists of 'private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality 
of life'. Philanthropy contrasts with business initiatives, which are private 
initiatives for private good, focusing on material gain, and with government 
endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on 
provision of public services. A person who practices philanthropy is a 
philanthropist.

Philanthropy is different from charity, though there is some overlap. Charity 
aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem, whereas philanthropy 
attempts to address the root cause of the problem."

Please note that the Wikipedia authors assign charity as the mere treatment 
of symptoms, yet elevate philanthropy above charity by describing the works 
as addressing the root of the problem.



"A philanthropist is someone who engages in philanthropy; donating his or her 
time, money, and/or reputation to charitable causes. The term may apply to any 
volunteer or to anyone who makes a donation, but the label is most often 
applied to those who donate large sums of money or who make a major impact 
through their volunteering, such as a trustee who manages a philanthropic 
organization or one who establishes and funds a foundation."
