## Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation "is reported to be the largest private foundation in the world, holding $46.8 billion in assets. The primary goals of the 
foundation are, globally, to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty, 
and, in the U.S., to expand educational opportunities and access to information 
technology."
