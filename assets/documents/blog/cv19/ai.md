## Artificial Intelligence

### Introduction

1. **Frontline: In the Age of AI**

A documentary exploring how artificial intelligence is changing life as we 
know it â€” from jobs to privacy to a growing rivalry between the U.S. and China.

FRONTLINE investigates the promise and perils of AI and automation, tracing a 
new industrial revolution that will reshape and disrupt our world, and allow 
the emergence of a surveillance society.

4. [Microsoft Jericho Project]

"A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to understand and communicate 
with language."  Also, from the introduction:  "Beyond [interactive fiction], 
real-world applications such as voice-activated personal assistants can also 
benefit from advances in these capabilities at the intersection of natural 
language understanding, natural language generation, and sequential decision 
making."
