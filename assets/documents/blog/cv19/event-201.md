## [Event 201](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/)

"The Event 201 pandemic tabletop exercise [was] hosted by The Johns Hopkins 
Center for Health Security in partnership with the 
[World Economic Forum](#pages/blog/cv19/wef) and 
the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/bilmel) on 
October 18, 2019, in New York, NY.  The exercise illustrated the pandemic 
preparedness efforts needed to diminish the large-scale economic and 
societal consequences of a severe pandemic.
 
Drawing from actual events, Event 201 identifies important policy issues and 
preparedness challenges that could be solved with sufficient political will 
and attention. These issues were designed in a narrative to engage and educate 
the participants and the audience." [(Youtube playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174&list=PL9-oVXQX88esnrdhaiuRdXGG7XOVYB9Xm)
