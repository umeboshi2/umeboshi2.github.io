## World Economic Forum

The [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/), according to
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum),
"is a membership-based organization, and membership is made up of the 
world's largest corporations."  Their new [manifesto](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/) is titled: *The Universal 
Purpose of a Company in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.*  They have a 
[strategic intelligence](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G0X000006O6EHUA0?tab=publications&type=Global+Issues) page for COVID-19.
"In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates 
that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature."

for Public-Private Cooperation."

#### What is the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

"Ubiquitous, mobile supercomputing. Artificially-intelligent robots. 
Self-driving cars. Neuro-technological brain enhancements. Genetic editing. 
The evidence of dramatic change is all around us and it’s happening at 
exponential speed. 

<div class="video-view" data-id="kpW9JcWxKq0"></div>

Previous industrial revolutions liberated humankind from animal power, made 
mass production possible and brought digital capabilities to billions of 
people. This Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, fundamentally 
different. It is characterized by a range of new technologies that are fusing 
the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines, 
economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be 
human."

To meet the challenges of the fourth revolution, the World Economies Forum 
updated their [manifesto](https://www.weforum.org/the-davos-manifesto)

[Davos Manifesto 2020: The Universal Purpose of a Company in the Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/)
