Mohammad Jaafar, Bob Moritz, Geraldine Matchett, Dr Phillip Atiba Goff, 
discuss how to rebuild the ‘social contract’ in a world where millions of 
people have lost their jobs and faith in democracy is under extreme pressure.

Cooperation. The Forum engages the foremost political, business, cultural and 
other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. We 
believe that progress happens by bringing together people from all walks of 
life who have the drive and the influence to make positive change."
