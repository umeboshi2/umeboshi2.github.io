## World Economic Forum

The [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/), according to
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum),
"is a membership-based organization, and membership is made up of the 
world's largest corporations."  Their new [manifesto](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/) is titled: *The Universal 
Purpose of a Company in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.*  They have a 
[strategic intelligence](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G0X000006O6EHUA0?tab=publications&type=Global+Issues) page for COVID-19.
"In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates 
that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature."

### Covid-19

The WEF has a [focus](https://www.weforum.org/focus/coronavirus-covid-19) on the 
COVID-19 crisis. They have a 
[transformation map](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1G0X000006O6EHUA0?tab=publications&type=Global+Issues) to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic..

#### Covid Action Platform

The [Covid Action Platform](https://www.weforum.org/covid-action-platform)
"demands global cooperation among governments, international organizations 
and the business community. This multistakeholder cooperation is at the 
centre of the World Economic Forum’s mission as the International Organization 
for Public-Private Cooperation."

The new COVID Action Platform will focus on three priorities:

  1. Galvanize the global business community for collective action

  1. Protect people’s livelihoods and facilitate business continuity

  1. Mobilize cooperation and business support for the COVID-19 response

The Great Reset: A Unique Twin Summit to Begin 2021

  - “The Great Reset” will be the theme of a unique twin summit in January 
	2021, convened by the World Economic Forum.

  - “The Great Reset” is a commitment to jointly and urgently build the 
	foundations of our economic and social system for a more fair, sustainable 
	and resilient future.

  - It **requires a new social contract** centred on human dignity, social 
	justice and where societal progress does not fall behind economic 
	development. The global health crisis has laid bare longstanding ruptures 
	in our economies and societies, and created a social crisis that urgently 
	requires decent, meaningful jobs. (Emphasis added)

  - The twin summit will be both in-person and virtual, connecting key 
	global governmental and business leaders in Davos with a global 
	multistakeholder network in 400 cities around the world for a 
	forward-oriented dialogue driven by the younger generation.

"The World Economic Forum will draw on thousands of young people in more than 
400 cities around the world (the Global Shapers Community) who will be 
interconnected with a powerful virtual hub network to interact with the 
leaders in Davos."

#### Great Reset Dialogues | Six leaders discuss why we must reform the social contract after COVID-19

"In the latest Great Reset dialogue, John Kerry, Jan Vapaavuori, Hilary Cottam, 
Mohammad Jaafar, Bob Moritz, Geraldine Matchett, Dr Phillip Atiba Goff, 
discuss how to rebuild the ‘social contract’ in a world where millions of 
people have lost their jobs and faith in democracy is under extreme pressure.

The World Economic Forum is the International Organization for Public-Private 
Cooperation. The Forum engages the foremost political, business, cultural and 
other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. We 
believe that progress happens by bringing together people from all walks of 
life who have the drive and the influence to make positive change."

#### Creating a Credible and Trusted Digital Currency

In this video, speakers explore "[t]he possibility of a trusted  *global 
digital currency* [which] has sparked political, economic and regulatory 
discussions worldwide."


#### What is the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

"Ubiquitous, mobile supercomputing. Artificially-intelligent robots. 
Self-driving cars. Neuro-technological brain enhancements. Genetic editing. 
The evidence of dramatic change is all around us and it’s happening at 
exponential speed.

Previous industrial revolutions liberated humankind from animal power, made 
mass production possible and brought digital capabilities to billions of 
people. This Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, fundamentally 
different. It is characterized by a range of new technologies that are fusing 
the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines, 
economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be 
human."

#### The Great Reset | Launch session 3 June 2020

"The Great Reset” will be the theme of a unique twin summit to be convened by 
the World Economic Forum in January 2021. In-person and virtual dialogues will 
address the need for a more fair, sustainable and resilient future, and a new 
social contract centred on human dignity, social justice and where societal 
progress does not fall behind economic development."

#### Family Business: Relic or Role Model? | DAVOS 2020

"Successful family businesses are rooted in tradition, yet vested in the 
future thanks to an intergenerational mindset and culture. What can other 
businesses learn from them about sustainable, profitable and equitable business 
practice?"
