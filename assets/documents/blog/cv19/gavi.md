## GAVI

"GAVI's approach to public health has been described as business-oriented and 
technology-focused, using market-oriented measures, and seeking quantifiable 
results. This model, termed the "Gates approach" or US-type approach, GAVI is 
taken to exemplify." 
"GAVI brings together developing country and donor governments, the 
World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry in 
both industrialised and developing countries, research and technical 
agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other 
private philanthropists. GAVI has observer status at the World Health Assembly.
"The [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/bilmel)
has donated $1.56 billion to the 
alliance's 2016-2020 strategic period, as of March 2019."

### Global Vaccine Summit 2020

"The UK-hosted Global Vaccine Summit heralds a new era of global health 
collaboration as world leaders show overwhelming commitment to equitable 
immunisation coverage and global health security in the face of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The virtual event raised US$ 8.8 billion from 32 donor governments 
and 12 foundations, corporations and organisations to immunise 300 million 
children and support the global fight against 
COVID-19."
