## GAVI

Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI), 
for GAVI. [Seth Berkley](#pages/blog/cv19/people/seth-berkley) is the 
current CEO of GAVI; he "worked for the 
[Rockefeller Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/rocky), initially as program 
scientist and finally as associate director of the Health Sciences 
Division. During his eight years with the Rockefeller Foundation, Berkley 
managed programs in epidemiology, public health, medical and nursing 
education, vaccination, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and 
reproductive health in Africa, Asia, and Latin America."
[(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Berkley), 



"GAVI's approach to public health has been described as business-oriented and 
technology-focused, using market-oriented measures, and seeking quantifiable 
results. This model, termed the "Gates approach" or US-type approach, GAVI is 
taken to exemplify." 
"GAVI brings together developing country and donor governments, the 
World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry in 
both industrialised and developing countries, research and technical 
agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other 
private philanthropists. GAVI has observer status at the World Health Assembly.
"The [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/bilmel)
has donated $1.56 billion to the 
alliance's 2016-2020 strategic period, as of March 2019."
[(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI) 

"It was Gates who sponsored the meeting that led to the creation of Gavi, the 
Vaccine Alliance, a global public-private partnership bringing together state 
sponsors and big pharmaceutical companies, whose specific goals include the 
creation of 'healthy markets for vaccines and other immunisation products.' As 
a founding partner of the alliance, the Gates Foundation provided $750 million 
in seed funding and has gone on to make over $4.1 billion in commitments to the 
group." *[Who Is Bill Gates?](https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/)

### Global Vaccine Summit 2020

"The UK-hosted Global Vaccine Summit heralds a new era of global health 
collaboration as world leaders show overwhelming commitment to equitable 
immunisation coverage and global health security in the face of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The virtual event raised US$ 8.8 billion from 32 donor governments 
and 12 foundations, corporations and organisations to immunise 300 million 
children and support the global fight against 
COVID-19."
