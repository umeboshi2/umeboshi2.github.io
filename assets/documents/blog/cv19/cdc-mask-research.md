# CDC Mask Research

The CDC recommendation for cloth mask usage by the general public is based on 
[recent studies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html#recent-studies).  The first eleven papers help
focus on the transmission of the infection.

## Extra Research

1. [Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988269/)
   This paper discusses false negative and false positive rates of RT-PCR 
   tests.
   

# Notes

**Rothe:**  In Germany, patient A becomes ill on Jan 24.  Before symptoms, 
he meets with patient B on Jan 21 and Jan 22.  Patient B is in Germany between 
Jan 19 and 22,  with no symptoms, but becomes ill on her flight back to China.  
Other patients were found to be infected later.  This paper suggests that 
Patient A transitted the virus to Patient B.  If this is true, it idicates 
transmission prior to developing symptoms.

**Zou:**  This paper reports on 18 patients, with a single patient, Z, being
completely asymptomatic.  Patient Z tested positive and a viral load was 
detected in his nose and throat swabs for three different days.  While there
is no indication that patient Z ever transmitted an infection, but the viral 
load present in patient Z, along with a reference to *Rothe,* is the basis for
a call to further research on the potential of asymptomatic transmission.

**Pan:**  In this paper, a man, his wife, and his son traveled by train from 
Wuhan to Guangzhou.  The man develops symptoms four days later.  All three 
tested positive for the virus.  The paper acknowledges that any one of those
patients could have been the first one, then presumes that one of them must 
have infected the other two.  The paper expresses concern that asymptomatic 
people may be unaware of their infection.

**Bai:**  This paper concerns six patients, with patient A being asymptomatic.  
The five patients did not come into known contact with any person who tested 
positive for covid, except patient A.  The timeline is difficult to review for 
a person with poor eyesight, but the paper indicates a lengty incubation period. 
While asymptomatic tranmission is also presumed in this paper, this paper 
provides better support for the premise of asymptomatic transmission than the 
other papers so far.  Even so, as with the other papers reviewed, there remains 
the possibility that infections originated in another person with mild symptoms 
who was never known about or identified.  Also, the paper hints at being 
inconclusive and requests further study of "[t]he mechanism by which 
asymptomatic carriers could acquire and transmit the coronavirus that causes 
COVID-19."
