# CDC Mask Research

The CDC recommendation for cloth mask usage by the general public is based on 
[recent studies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html#recent-studies).  The first eleven papers help
focus on the transmission of the infection.

# Notes

**Rothe**:  In Germany, patient A becomes ill on Jan 24.  Before symptoms, he meets with patient B on Jan 21 and Jan 22.  She is in Germany between Jan 19 
and 22,  with no symptoms, but becomes ill on her flight back to China.  Other 
patients were found to be infected later.  This paper suggests that Patient A 
transitted the virus to Patient B.  If this is true, it idicates transmission 
prior to developing symptoms.
