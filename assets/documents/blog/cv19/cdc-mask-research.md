# CDC Mask Research

The CDC recommendation for cloth mask usage by the general public is based on 
[recent studies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html#recent-studies).  The first eleven papers help
focus on the transmission of the infection.

# Notes

**Rothe:**  In Germany, patient A becomes ill on Jan 24.  Before symptoms, 
he meets with patient B on Jan 21 and Jan 22.  Patient B is in Germany between 
Jan 19 and 22,  with no symptoms, but becomes ill on her flight back to China. 
Other patients were found to be infected later.  This paper suggests that 
Patient A transitted the virus to Patient B.  If this is true, it idicates 
transmission prior to developing symptoms.

**Zou:**  This paper reports on 18 patients, with a single patient, Z, being
completely asymptomatic.  Patient Z tested positive and a viral load was 
detected in his nose and throat swabs for three different days.  While there
is no indication that patient Z ever transmitted an infection, but the viral 
load present in patient Z, along with a reference to *Rothe,* is the basis for
a call to further research on the potential of asymptomatic transmission.

**Pan:**  In this paper, a man, his wife, and his son traveled by train from 
Wuhan to Guangzhou.  The man develops symptoms four days later.  All three 
tested positive for the virus.  The paper acknowledges that any one of those
patients could have been the first one, then presumes that one of them must 
have infected the other two.  The paper expresses concern that asymptomatic 
people may be unaware of their infection.

**Bai:**  This paper concerns six patients, with patient A being asymptomatic.
The five patients did not come into known contact with any person who tested 
positive for covid, except patient A.  The timeline is difficult to review for 
a person with poor eyesight, but the paper indicates a lengty incubation period. 
While asymptomatic tranmission is also presumed in this paper, this paper 
provides better support for the premise of asymptomatic transmission than the 
other papers so far.  Even so, as with the other papers reviewed, there remains 
the possibility that infections originated in another person with mild symptoms 
who was never known about or identified.  Also, the paper hints at being 
inconclusive and requests further study of "[t]he mechanism by which 
asymptomatic carriers could acquire and transmit the coronavirus that causes 
COVID-19."

**Kimball:**  In this study, a worker at a nursing home was the symptomatic 
index patient.  "[T]hese findings do not quantify the relative contributions of 
asymptomatic or presymptomatic residents to SARS-CoV-2 transmission in facility 
A, [however] they suggest that these residents have the potential for 
substantial viral shedding."  The paper also relies upon a mistaken 
interpretation of *Zou* by presuming that  "asymptomatic adults in China 
[...] were *known* to transmit SARS-CoV-2."  However, *Zou* merely suggested 
the possibility that patient Z may have been able to transmit the virus due 
to the viral load present in a positive PCR test result.

**Wei:**  This study looks at possibility of presymptomatic transmissions in 
seven different clusters of patients.  *Kimball* is one of the three papers 
relied upon to support the suggestion of presymptomatic transmission.  The other 
two papers are listed in the "Extra Research" section of this page.  This 
study is concerned solely with the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, 
while asymptomatic transmission is never touched upon in the report.

**Li:**  This study uses "a model-inference framework to estimate the 
contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infections in China during the 
weeks before and after the shutdown of travel in and out of Wuhan."  The paper 
presumes that "that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible 
interval (CI): 82–90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions."  This 
paper presumes transmission and attempts to measure the effect of those 
transmissions on populations.

**Furukawa:**  This study reviewed "the literature in PubMed [on] articles 
that were published from January 1 through April 2, 2020, and pertained to 
presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission."  The study notes that 
"[a]n inherent confounder to these reports from China is the inability to 
entirely rule out alternative SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community early in 
the outbreak, when transmission in the community may have been undetected."
The study also notes how viral load has been interpreted as an indicator of 
possible transmission, stating that "[a]lthough these reports did not identify 
actual virus transmission while presymptomatic or asymptomatic, the low 
RT-PCR Ct values (i.e., high viral load) and ability to isolate infectious 
SARS-CoV-2 provide plausible virologic evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission 
by persons not demonstrating symptoms."

**Oran:**  This study is similar to the *Furukawa* study in that it is a review 
of prior literature available on Pubmed.
