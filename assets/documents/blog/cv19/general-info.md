# Data for Mississippi

[MSDH](https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html ) is the source 
of authority for the information provided to the CDC  or whatever federal 
agency who is currently in charge of receiving the data.

[Forrest General Hospital](https://fhcovid19.com/) used to provide local 
daily data, but decided to stop on June 2, 2020 to inspire and encourage 
the reopening of our economy.

[Forrest County](https://covidactnow.org/us/ms/county/forrest_county?s=647107)
data on bed usage is provided by this site, but it is unknown how accurate this 
data is.
