"Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.
[...]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued Mastercard in federal court for making 
them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically 
increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a 
multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest antitrust award in 
history."

## World Beyond Cash

"In 2017 CEO Ajay Banga reinforced the company's goal of extending financial 
services to those outside the current system by bringing digital payment 
systems to the unbanked around the world. The company invested $500M in India 
with offices in Pune and Vadodara to help Mastercard bring cashless 
transactions to the 2nd largest population in the world. The company also is 
scheduled to invest an additional $750M in cashless apps and techonlogy, 
especially focused on India between 2017 and 2020."

## COVID-19 Assistance

"Mastercard approached TrustStamp in 2018 and invited them to join the 
Mastercard Start Path Program. The goal of the partership is integrating 
TrustStamp's biometric and facial recognition technology into the Mastercard 
Well Pass platform. This partnership would enable biometric tracking of 
vaccinations, especially for children. The program is based on the TrustStamp 
Evergreen Hash, which is a personal digital token that is tied to a 
fingerprint, palm or face. The AI software creates a 3D 'mask' and then the 
original data is destroyed. The token would then adapt as the individual 
does, creating a lifelong identification system.

This system is now being implemented in West Africa through parternship 
with [GAVI](#pages/blog/cv19/gavi), 
[The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/bilmel)
and NuData. The Mastercard 
wellness program was adapted in response to the COVID-19 crisis and now 
Mastercard is working with TrustStamp and GAVI to bring integrated vaccine 
verification and payment systems to Developing countries throughout the world."
