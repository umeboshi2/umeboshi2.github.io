### Cell Phone Radiation Controversy - Part 1

In Dr. Devra Lee Davis's latest book, she argues that the most popular gadget of our age has now been shown to damage DNA, break down the brain's defenses, and reduce sperm count while increasing memory loss, the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and even cancer. As this eye-opening call to action shows, we can make safer cell phones now.

**Speaker:**
Devra Lee Davis, PhD, MPH, Founder and President, Environmental Health Trust, Professor, Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Public Health

**Event Date:** Tuesday, April 12, 2011

### "The truth about mobile phone and wireless radiation" -- Dr Devra Davis

"The truth about mobile phone and wireless radiation: what we know, what we 
need to find out, and what you can do now"
Presented by Dr Devra Davis, Visiting Professor of Medicine at the Hebrew 
University Hadassah Medical School, and Visiting Professor of Medicine at 
Ondokuz Mayis University, Turkey.

The Lecture
What are the health effects of mobile phones and wireless radiation? While 
Australia has led the world in safety standards, including compulsory seat-belt 
legislation, plain packaging on cigarettes, and product and food disclosure 
legislation, it falls behind in addressing the significant issues associated 
with mobile phone use. In this Dean’s Lecture, epidemiologist and 
electromagnetic radiation expert, Dr Devra Davis, will outline the evolution of 
the mobile phone and smartphone, and provide a background to the current 19 
year old radiation safety standards (SAR), policy developments and 
international legislation. New global studies on the health consequences of 
mobile/wireless radiation will be presented, including children’s exposure and 
risks.
