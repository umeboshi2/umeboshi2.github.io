## Dead Scientists

[Dead Microbiologists](https://rense.com/general96/deadmicro.html)
"This compilation of biologist and microbiologist deaths indeed causes one to 
wonder if someone, somewhere does not want men and women alive who may see 
through pandemic scare tactics and, worse yet from their standpoint, be able to 
produce effective antidotes."


"Eleven microbiologists mysteriously dead over the span of just five 
months. Some of them world leaders in developing weapons-grade biological 
plagues. Others the best in figuring out how to stop millions from dying 
because of biological weapons. Still others, experts in the theory of 
bioterrorism."
