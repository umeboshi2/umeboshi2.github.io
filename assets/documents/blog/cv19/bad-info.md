## [Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic)

#### Bio-engineered virus

In 2015 Nature Medicine published a 
[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797993/) 
by an international group of researches (including Shi Zhengli who in 2019 
identified SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan) on creating a chimeric virus pathogenic to 
humans.

In 2020 Nature Medicine published an 
[article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095063/) arguing 
against the conspiracy theory that the virus was created artificially. The high-
affinity binding of its peplomers to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) was shown to be "most likely the result of natural selection on a human 
or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise"
