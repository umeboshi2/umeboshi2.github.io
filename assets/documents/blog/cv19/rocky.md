## The Rockefeller Foundation

The Rockefeller Foundation is a founding partner 
of [ID2020](#pages/blog/cv19/id2020).

[Official Site](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/)

[A Digital history](https://rockfound.rockarch.org/home)




"Through the years the foundation has expanded greatly in scope. Historically, 
it has given more than $14 billion in current dollars to thousands of grantees 
worldwide and has assisted directly in the training of nearly 13,000 
Rockefeller Fellows.

Its overall philanthropic activity has been divided into five main subject areas:

  - Medical, health, and population sciences
  - Agricultural and natural sciences
  - Arts and humanities
  - Social sciences
  - International relations"
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation), 

"Only through a unified and clear national plan can we beat this insidious 
virus, protect the most vulnerable in our communities, and preserve our 
economic and social vitality." [Foundation Action Plan](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/national-covid-19-testing-and-tracing-action-plan/)

"In 1901, Gates designed the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University), of which he was board president. He then designed the Rockefeller Foundation, becoming a trustee upon its creation in 1913. Gates served as president of the General Education Board, which became the leading foundation in the field of education." [Frederick Taylor Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Taylor_Gates)

"The so-called morning-after pill has not yet been tested in human beings; 
its effectiveness and the hazards of its use are unknown. The male pill is 
being very little investigated; several types of drugs are known to diminish 
male fertility, but those that have been tested have serious problems of 
toxicity. Very little work is in progress on immunological methods, such as 
vaccines, to reduce fertility, and much more research is required if a solution 
is to be found here."

### [Carnegie Flexner Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexner_Report)

Although the report is over 100 years old, many of its recommendations are 
still relevant—particularly those concerning the physician as a "**social 
instrument**... whose function is fast becoming *social and preventive*, 
rather than *individual and curative*." 
[(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexner_Report)

In the early half of the 20th century, a coup was organized on the medical 
research facilities, hospitals and universities. The Rockefeller family, ye 
ole step-n-fetch-its of the actual slavemasters, sponsored research and 
donated sums to universities and medical schools which had drug based 
research. Establishments and research which were were not drug based were 
refused funding and soon dissolved in favor of the lucrative pharmaceutical 
industry.

The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was founded in 1901. Simon 
Flexner headed the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research. Simon Flexner 
appointed his brother, Abraham Flexner, to survey medical schools throughout 
America.

Abraham Flexner was empowered to investigate the quality of medical education 
in all 161 medical schools that existed in 1910. He helped destroy the 
credibility and funding sources for nearly all schools using non-drug based 
medicine. 161 medical schools dwindled down to 81 by 1919 and medical graduates 
declined from 5,747 to 2,658. "Overcrowding" of the profession became the 
public AMA theme for the "opportunities of those already in the profession to 
acquire a livelihood." said one AMA President at the time.

The AMA also practiced **severe** discrimination against black medical schools 
and black doctors. They did not apologize for this for over 150 years, until 
July 2008. (Exploring the AMA's History of Discrimination, 2008)

### Rockefeller Medicine Men (1979)

"By the 1930s, however, medicine was firmly in the hands of an organized 
profession that controlled entry into the field through licensure and 
accreditation of medical schools and teaching hospitals. The profession also 
controlled the practice and economics of medicine through local medical 
societies. "Medicine" had come to mean the field of clinical practice by 
graduates of schools that followed the scientific, clinical, and research 
orientations laid down by the American Medical Association (AMA) and by 
Abraham Flexner in a famous report for the Carnegie Foundation. All other 
healers were being excluded from practice."
