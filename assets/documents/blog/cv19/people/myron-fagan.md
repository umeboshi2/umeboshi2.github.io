**Myron Fagan exposes the Illuminati/CFR [1967]**

This 3x LP record set documents the activities of a secret society known as 
The Illuminati, and their New World Order.

Mr. Fagan describes with documentary evidence how the ILLUMINATI became 
the instrument of the House of Rothschild to achieve a "One World Government".

Mr. Fagan relentlessly uncovered plots for major historical events. Myron 
Fagan is considered to be the archetype for the PCT (Paranoid 
Conspiracy Theorist)

This Recording is one of the most interesting and yet horrifying, factual 
stories of some of the most sensational plots in the history of the world.

The findings by Mr. Fagan were split into 6 parts, between these 3 records 
and are presented to you here, in full.

Each record has some descriptive notes on the back of each jacket such as...

- Eliminate the Illuminati...see that this message is heard!!!

- Play this for the unaware, uninformed and well meaning people who 
  desire to hear the truth. Don't waste your time on the hard core socialists 
  who have already repudiated principle.

- Buy Air-time with your club or organization! Get free time! No station is 
  too small!

- Use at coffees - Luncheons - meetings - everywhere and often. We must 
  succeed - Our children's liberty is at stake - Freedom has no 
  substitute - America no equal!
