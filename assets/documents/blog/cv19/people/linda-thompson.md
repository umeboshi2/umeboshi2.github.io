Linda Thompson "was an American lawyer and militia movement supporter. In 1993, 
she quit her job as a lawyer in Indianapolis, Indiana to start the American 
Justice Federation,[3] a non-profit group that promoted pro-gun causes 
through a shortwave radio program, a computer bulletin board system, and 
sales of its newsletter and videos.[4][5] She died of a prescription drug 
overdose in 2009."

## America Under Siege

Linda Thompson "made a third film in 1994, America Under Siege accusing the 
government of using "black helicopters" against patriots, and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency of establishing concentration camps, facilities she 
claimed were to prevent patriots from interfering with plans to establish a 
"New World Order".[4][5][9] The supposed FEMA Camp was the Beech Grove Shops, 
an Amtrak repair facility in Beech Grove, Indiana.
