## Norman Dodd On Tax Exempt Foundations

[Norman Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Dodd) was interviewed in 
1982 by G. Edward Griffin regarding the time he spent as the head researcher 
for the [Reece Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_Tax-Exempt_Foundations_and_Comparable_Organizations).

This is a truly eye opening look into what the tax exempt foundations are 
doing in the United States - their attempt to merge the Soviet System of 
Government with the USA.
