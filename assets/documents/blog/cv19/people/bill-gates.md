[Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) "is best known as the 
co-founder of [Microsoft Corporation](#pages/blog/cv19/microsoft).
[...]
Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 
2008, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He has given 
sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific 
research programs through the 
[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/bilmel), 
reported to be the world's largest private charity.  In 2009, Gates and 
[Warren Buffett](#pages/blog/cv19/people/warren-buggett) founded 
The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least 
half of their wealth to philanthropy."
