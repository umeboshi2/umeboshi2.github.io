[Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) "is best known as the 
co-founder of [Microsoft Corporation](#pages/blog/cv19/microsoft).
[...]
Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 
2008, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He has given 
sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific 
research programs through the 
[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/bilmel), 
reported to be the world's largest private charity.  In 2009, Gates and 
[Warren Buffett](#pages/blog/cv19/people/warren-buggett) founded 
The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least 
half of their wealth to philanthropy.

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview 
that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In 
the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable 
activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state 
of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 
50 years into the future, Gates stated: '... there'll be some really bad things 
that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the 
scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, 
or nuclear or bioterrorism.'

In an interview that was held at the TED conference in March 2015, with 
Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates said he would "highly recommend" Nick Bostrom's 
recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.  During the 
conference, Gates warned that the world was not prepared for the next 
pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in late 2019 when the 
COVID-19 pandemic began.
[...]
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive 
[philanthropy](#pages/blog/cv19/philanthropy) of 
David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with 
Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the 
Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in 
tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other 
organizations.[99] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most 
generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to 
charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to 
charity."
