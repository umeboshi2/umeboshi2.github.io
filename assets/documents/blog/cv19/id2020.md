which advocates for digital ID for the billion undocumented people worldwide 
and under-served groups like refugees. Dakota Gruener is the executive director 
of ID2020. The NGO was relatively unknown before being publicized because of 
misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic by conspiracy theorists."

challenge."
