## ID2020 Digital Identity Alliance

The [ID2020 Digital Identity Alliance](https://id2020.org/), as told by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID2020) "is a nongovernmental organization 
which advocates for digital ID for the billion undocumented people worldwide 
and under-served groups like refugees. [Dakota Gruener](#pages/blog/cv19/people/dakota-gruener) is the executive director of ID2020. The NGO was relatively 
unknown before being publicized because of misinformation related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic by conspiracy theorists."

The [partnership](https://id2020.org/alliance) consists of 
[Accenture](#pages/blog/cv19/accenture),
[GAVI](#pages/blog/cv19/gavi), 
[The Rockefeller Foundation](#pages/blog/cv19/rocky),
[Microsoft](#pages/blog/cv19/microsoft), 
and [IDEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEO). They 
have a [manifesto](https://id2020.org/manifesto) and "[a]n approach that is 
**holistic, market-based** and addresses the full scope and scale of the 
challenge."
In their [2018: End of Year Letter](https://medium.com/id2020/2018-end-of-year-letter-b740a83e9df3),
they stated that "[d]igital identity was a hot topic at the 
World Economic Forum
annual meeting in [Davos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos), Switzerland 
in January."

"In May 2016, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, PwC was, along 
with Microsoft, one of the principal sponsors of the inaugural ID2020 Summit."
