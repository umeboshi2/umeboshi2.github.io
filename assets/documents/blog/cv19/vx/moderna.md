## [Moderna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rossi

The Moderna technology platform is to insert synthetic mRNA into living cells that would reprogram the cells to develop immune responses, rather than being created externally and injected as with conventional medicines. It is a novel technique abandoned by several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that were unable to overcome the side effects of inserting RNA into cells.  As of May 2020, no mRNA drug has been approved for human use.
