[modRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside-modified_messenger_RNA)

To induce cells to make proteins that they do not normally produce, it is 
possible to introduce heterologous mRNA into the cytoplasm of the cell, 
bypassing the need for transcription. In other words, a blueprint for foreign 
proteins is "smuggled" into the cells. To achieve this goal, however, one must 
bypass cellular systems that prevent the penetration and translation of foreign 
mRNA.

RNA transfection is the process of deliberately introducing RNA into a 
living cell.
