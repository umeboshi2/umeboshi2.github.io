**Vaccination refusal, hesitancy, acceptance and demand | Robb Butler**
February 28, 2020

Did vaccination refusal and hesitancy contribute to a resurgence of multiple outbreaks of measles in the European Region? Dr Robb Butler (WHO Regional Office for Europe) presents the status of measles elimination, how vaccine hesitancy manifests itself in the European Region, and the tools we have available to combat it.

###  ACIP

The [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/index.html) just recently met on July 29: 

They had some [slides](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2020-07.html) for the meeting. The page of slides was removed on July 31, but is still available on 
the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163428/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2020-07.html).
[Fink's presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163601/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-07/COVID-04-Fink-508.pdf)
contains a very likely reason why the 
[HCQ treatment platform](#pages/blog/cv19/hcq) is an obstacle to authorize 
the emergency use of a vaccine, and will likely be further discredited to 
provide a better opportunity to authorize emergency vaccination.  On the 
fifth page of the slideshow, we can see that the criteria for an EUA on 
a vaccine requires that there be "[n]o adequate, approved, and available 
alternative" to a vaccine.
