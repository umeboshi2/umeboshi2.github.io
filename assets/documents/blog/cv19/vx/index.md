###  ACIP

The [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/index.html) just recently met on July 29: 

They had some [slides](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2020-07.html) for the meeting. The page of slides was removed on July 31, but is still available on 
the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163428/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2020-07.html).
[Fink's presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163601/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-07/COVID-04-Fink-508.pdf)
contains a very likely reason why the 
[HCQ treatment platform](#pages/blog/cv19/hcq) is an obstacle to authorize 
the emergency use of a vaccine, and will likely be further discredited to 
provide a better opportunity to authorize emergency vaccination.  On the 
fifth page of the slideshow, we can see that the criteria for an EUA on 
a vaccine requires that there be "[n]o adequate, approved, and available 
alternative" to a vaccine.
