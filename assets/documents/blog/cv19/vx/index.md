[Vaccination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination) is the administration 
of a [vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine) to help the immune 
system develop protection from a disease.  Vaccines contain a microorganism 
or virus in a weakened, live or killed state, or proteins or toxins from the 
organism.  A [vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine) is a biological 
preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious 
disease.

An older 
[revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaccine&oldid=446157626) 
of the vaccine page doesn't include surface protein in the definition.  
"A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular 
disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing 
microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe 
or its toxins." [Surface protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaccine&diff=465203458&oldid=464453190) was added on December 11, 2011.

###  ACIP

The [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/index.html) just recently met on July 29: 

They had some [slides](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2020-07.html) for the meeting. The page of slides was removed on July 31, but is still available on 
the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163428/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2020-07.html).
[Fink's presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163601/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-07/COVID-04-Fink-508.pdf)
contains a very likely reason why the 
[HCQ treatment platform](#pages/blog/cv19/hcq) is an obstacle to authorize 
the emergency use of a vaccine, and will likely be further discredited to 
provide a better opportunity to authorize emergency vaccination.  On the 
fifth page of the slideshow, we can see that the criteria for an EUA on 
a vaccine requires that there be "[n]o adequate, approved, and available 
alternative" to a vaccine.
