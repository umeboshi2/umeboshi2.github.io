## [Clade X](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/index.html)

"Clade X is a day-long pandemic tabletop 
[exercise](#pages/blog/cv19/biodefense-exercises)
hosted by the [Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security](#pages/blog/cv19/jhchs)
on May 15, 2018, in Washington, DC. The exercise 
simulates a series of National Security Council-convened meetings of 10 US 
government leaders, played by individuals prominent in the fields of national 
security or epidemic response.

Drawing from actual events, Clade X identifies important policy issues and 
preparedness challenges that could be solved with sufficient political will and 
attention. These issues were designed in a narrative to engage and educate the 
participants and the audience. Lessons learned from Clade X will be distilled 
by the Center and shared broadly." [(Youtube Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ1x8SlNxj0&list=PL9-oVXQX88etOom0YJndz0xw21AnQmfvV)

### Clade X Pandemic Simulation 2018

"In this simulation of May 2018 by the John Hopkins Center for Health Security, a scenario is being played out where a terrorist group has been able to create and spread a flu virus that killed 2% of the global population and crashed the global economy (90% crash) within 20 months, with no vaccine successfully developed within 20 months. The simulation was called Clade X. 
The complete simulation is available on YouTube 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Clade+X)."

##### United States Plan for a Pandemic

"The mutated virus dubbed 'Clade X'  is born and spreading across the globe 
fast. What's the United States' plan for this sweeping pandemic? In today's 
educational video we're going to see exactly how the US would handle this new 
virus "Clade X" and you can see the safety protocols that would be put in 
place, like quarantine and isolation. And for the sake of all of humanity, 
wash your hands, and if you can, stay home."
