## HCQ Treatment Platform

"On 17 March 2020, 
[[Didier] Raoult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Raoult) 
announced in an [online video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4J8kydOvbc)
that a trial involving 24 patients from southeast 
France supported the claim that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were 
effective in treating for COVID-19." [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Raoult#COVID-19)

In early April, 2020, "[a] 46-year-old Ukrainian, Vladimir (Zev) Zelenko, who 
has been working as a doctor in the United States for the past 16 years, claims 
to have developed a drug regimen for treating coronavirus that has cured at 
least 700 people." [(How to Cure Coronavirus: an Exclusive Letter From Dr. Zelenko to Donald Trump)](https://internetprotocol.co/hype-news/2020/04/07/how-to-cure-coronavirus-an-exclusive-letter-to-donald-trump/)
In his letter to President Trump, he stated that

  1. "We need an immediate supply of 1.5 billion pills of HCQ 200mg, 500 
  million pills of Azithromycin 500mg, 500 million pills of zinc sulfate 
  220mg (or its equivalent - we need 50mg elemental zinc)."
  
  1. "I suggest the following prophylactic regimen for very high risk patients
      1. Hydroxychloroquine 200mg once a day for 5 days, and then 1 pill 
		 a week until immunity can be shown or a vaccine becomes available.
      1. Zinc Sulfate 220mg once a day for 5 days, and then 1 pill a week 
		 until immunity can be shown or a vaccine becomes available."



Dr. Zelenko recommended using [zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc) as a
viral blocking agent, inhibiting reproduction.
