# The Giving Pledge

[The Giving Pledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge) "is a 
campaign to encourage extremely wealthy people to contribute a majority of 
their wealth to philanthropic causes. As of May 2019, the pledge has 204 
signatories, either individuals or couples, from 22 countries, though some of 
the signers have died since signing.[1] Most of the signatories of the pledge 
are billionaires, and their pledges total $1.2 trillion.

In June 2010, the Giving Pledge campaign was formally announced and 
[Bill Gates](#pages/blog/cv19/people/bill-gates) and 
[Warren Buffett](#pages/blog/cv19/people/warren-buffett) began recruiting 
members."
