## [Population Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_Council)

The [Population Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_Council) was 
established in 1952 by [John D. Rockefeller III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller_III).

"In the 1960s, the Council played a key role in documenting the large numbers 
of people in poor countries who lacked access to contraceptives and in 
conducting research to design and evaluate public family planning programs. 
This included bringing IUDs to India."

"John D. Rockefeller [III] returned from his trips to Asia convinced that 
'political stability' and 'economic progress' in that part of the world 
depended on putting a stop to unrestrained reproduction.

A few years later, the 'population explosion' was a well known concept 
throughout the rich part of the world.  John D. Rockefeller financed the first 
academic conference on the subject. He started the American Population Council 
and contributed to making population control a goal for US politics in the 
Third World. The financial aristocrat disguised his urge to restrain the Asian 
masses in campaigns for birth control and family planning.
