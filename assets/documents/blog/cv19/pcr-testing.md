The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR 
Experiments [MIQE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIQE) guidelines "were devised 
after a paper was published in 2002 that claimed to detect measles virus in 
children with autism through the use of RT-qPCR, but the results proved to be 
completely unreproducible by other scientists."

### PCR - Polymerase Chain Reaction Simplified

"Using PCR, copies of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified to generate 
thousands to millions of more copies of that particular DNA segment. PCR is now 
a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory and 
clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including 
biomedical research and criminal forensics. PCR was developed by Kary Mullis 
in 1983 while he was an employee of the Cetus Corporation. He was awarded the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 (along with Michael Smith) for his work in 
developing the method."

"Typically, PCR consists of a series of 20–40 repeated temperature changes, 
called thermal cycles, with each cycle commonly consisting of two or three 
discrete temperature steps. The cycling is often preceded by a single 
temperature step at a very high temperature (90 °C (194 °F), and followed by 
one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The 
temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend 
on a variety of parameters, including the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the 
concentration of bivalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the melting 
temperature (Tm) of the primers."
