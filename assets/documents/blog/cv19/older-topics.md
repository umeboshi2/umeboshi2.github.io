## Shadow Government

Senator [Daniel K. Inouye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Inouye) in 
1987 Chaired the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to 
Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition, which held public hearings on the 
[Iran-Contra affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair).

Senator Inouye, summarizes here the coverup of the US Shadowy Government 
involvement; by saying:

<div class="video-view" data-id="EbFphX5zb8w"></div>

"There exists a shadowy Government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its 
own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the 
national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law 
itself."

For more context and perspective, please check the PBS documentary by Bill 
Moyers "The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crises", which was broadcast 
in 1987; the full documentary could be watched on Google Video.
