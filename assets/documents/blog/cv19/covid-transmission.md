[brief](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions)  The papers listed 
below support the claim that "[t]ransmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur through 
direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected 
secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions or their respiratory 
droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or 
sings."
