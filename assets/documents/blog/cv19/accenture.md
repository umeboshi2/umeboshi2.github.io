## Accenture

Accenture is a founding partner of [ID2020](#pages/blog/cv19/id2020).


“Everyone shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before 
the law.” Article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

"Our solution is personal, private and portable, empowering individuals to 
access and share appropriate information when convenient and without the worry 
of using or losing paper documentation. To solve problems faced by people who 
lack official identities face, Accenture leverages its Unique Identity Service 
Platform to deploy a breakthrough **biometrics system that can manage 
fingerprints, iris scans and other data.**" (emphasis added)
"Accenture has joined the ID2020 Alliance with partners like Microsoft to 
create an open, human-centric approach to identity. The alliance draws on 
advances in biometrics and innovative technologies and brings together 
expertise from business, government and non-government agencies. Our experts 
at the Dublin Innovation Center contribute cross-functional and cross-cultural 
expertise to drive it forward in collaboration with both UN and other global 
humanitarian organizations. Get in touch with us."
