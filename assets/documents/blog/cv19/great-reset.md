The Great Reset: A Unique Twin Summit to Begin 2021

  - “The Great Reset” will be the theme of a unique twin summit in January 
	2021, convened by the World Economic Forum.

  - “The Great Reset” is a commitment to jointly and urgently build the 
	foundations of our economic and social system for a more fair, sustainable 
	and resilient future.

  - It **requires a new social contract** centred on human dignity, social 
	justice and where societal progress does not fall behind economic 
	development. The global health crisis has laid bare longstanding ruptures 
	in our economies and societies, and created a social crisis that urgently 
	requires decent, meaningful jobs. (Emphasis added)

  - The twin summit will be both in-person and virtual, connecting key 
	global governmental and business leaders in Davos with a global 
	multistakeholder network in 400 cities around the world for a 
	forward-oriented dialogue driven by the younger generation.

"The World Economic Forum will draw on thousands of young people in more than 
400 cities around the world (the Global Shapers Community) who will be 
interconnected with a powerful virtual hub network to interact with the 
leaders in Davos."

Cooperation. The Forum engages the foremost political, business, cultural and 
other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. We 
believe that progress happens by bringing together people from all walks of 
life who have the drive and the influence to make positive change."
