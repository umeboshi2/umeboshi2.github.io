Eugenical News changed their name to [Biodemography and Social Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodemography_and_Social_Biology).
"Biodemography and Social Biology was established in 1916 as Eugenical News. It 
was published under that title until 1953, during which time it was 'the 
primary source of eugenic-related events and news in the United States'. It was 
renamed Eugenics Quarterly in 1954, when it was launched by the 
[American Eugenics Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Eugenics_Society)
as a scholarly journal focused on eugenics and related subjects."



[Charles Davenport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Davenport)
"was a prominent American biologist and eugenicist. He was one of the leaders 
of the 
[American eugenics movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States).
