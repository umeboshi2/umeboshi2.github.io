### [Clade X](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/index.html)

"Clade X is a day-long pandemic tabletop exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins 
Center for Health Security on May 15, 2018, in Washington, DC. The exercise 
simulates a series of National Security Council-convened meetings of 10 US 
government leaders, played by individuals prominent in the fields of national 
security or epidemic response.

Drawing from actual events, Clade X identifies important policy issues and 
preparedness challenges that could be solved with sufficient political will and 
attention. These issues were designed in a narrative to engage and educate the 
participants and the audience. Lessons learned from Clade X will be distilled 
by the Center and shared broadly." [(Youtube Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ1x8SlNxj0&list=PL9-oVXQX88etOom0YJndz0xw21AnQmfvV)
