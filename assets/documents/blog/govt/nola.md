### Project NOLA

A [Slideshow](https://hattiesburgms.civicclerk.com/Web/GenFile.aspx?ad=3422) 
introducing Project NOLA was presented by Chief Parker at the work session 
on November 4, 2019.  After the chief finished the presentation, Ms. Delgado 
thanked the chief and declared her intention to further discuss the issue 
in a future work session.

A [professional services agreement](https://hattiesburgms.civicclerk.com/Web/GenFile.aspx?ad=4340)
was placed on the agenda for the meeting on January 21, 2020.  There was 
a large amount of discussion concerning the agreement.  The agreement was 
authorized by a 4 to 1 vote, with Ms. Delgado opposing.

An [alternative](https://www.scribd.com/document/449787789/Advanced-Neighborhood-Watch) 
to the agreement was introduced during the public forum held at the 
meeting.  This proposal used to be [online](https://hattiesburgms.civicclerk.com/Web/GenFile.aspx?ad=4330)
at the city website, but is no longer available.

The city posted a [faq](http://www.hattiesburgms.com/wp-content/uploads/project_nola_faq.pdf)
concerning Project NOLA.
