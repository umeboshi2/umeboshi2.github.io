I finished reporting tax fraud to the DOR. The form seems to be only setup to report on tax payers, rather than to report fraudulent "revenoors." I left my contact info, so I hope to hear from them soon! ï¿¼:)

Here is the text:
"The tax notice, identified as Notice 72-19-04, is fraudulent. The City of Hattiesburg operates under the Mayor-Council form of government, as provided by Title 21, Chapter 8 of our 1972 code.

The Council never adopted a resolution on May 1, 2019. The Council never met on that day. The date of the notice is April 30, 2019. The fact that the notice, clearly posted on 30 April, discusses an act of the city the next day in the past tense is clear and convincing evidence that an attempt to defraud the taxpayers of our municipality has occurred.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned fraud, the notice also defrauds the taxpayers by expressing a tax that we didn't levy, instead of the tax we actually levied. By neglecting the plain and clear language used in our tax resolution, the taxpayer is left unaware that they are being instructed by the Department of Revenue to collect the uniform and equal tax we levied and assessed in a nonuniform or unequal manner. Please correct this obvious error so that our taxpayers are not being deceived by a fraudulent notice."

The tax notice (72-19-04, issued 30April2019) posted by the DOR is fraudulent. I am reporting the fraud to the DOR. Is this getting the dog to chase its own tail?

Here is the evidence of how the Mississippi Department of Revenue is deceiving the taxpayers of the city and disrespecting the taxing authority of the City of Hattiesburg-Government. Most readers should notice that we don't have a board of aldermen in our city. Other careful readers may even notice that this notice attempts to predict the future by having an April 30 date of posting, but mentioning "what happened" the next day. We are unable to meet in chambers for any regular meeting on the first of any month, unless the meeting is specially called.

What this means is that we still don't have the one percent tax we voted to impose. This notice is so flawed, it fails to actually put the taxpayer on notice that an actual tax has been both levied and imposed.

As it stands today, no taxpayer has been properly notified that they are responsible for collecting another percentage of tax from the people.

This means, when you are being asked to give the extra percent at the point of sale, the business collecting this has no authority to collect from you, because the business has not been properly notified.

I tried to call the local collection office about this yesterday, but we couldn't even get past the first paragraph! The remaining flaws are a good exercise for the reader.

I will continue to pursue a uniform and even tax, since we actually levied and assessed this tax in a uniform and equal manner. The third part of taxation, known as collection, must be as uniform and equal as the levy and assessment.
