Here is the audio from citizens forum in council chambers this past Monday. i have just noticed that this address to the Council was done on "tax day!"

I know that I sound like one really dumb redneck in this clip, which is why I made sure to write everything down and leave a subscribed copy on the record. Having to speed through to meet the three minute time limit almost made a real tongue twister. Although my words will be accurately reflected on the record, since I tendered a written copy to the clerk, the response from the city attorney was verbal and unwritten. Since we hold citizens forum during normal business hours, the ability of the people to address the Council is impeded. Also impaired is the ability of the public to become spectators on the business our city regularly conducts.

This clip contains the entirety of citizens forum, in which I was the only participant. The clip starts with my address, then ends with a response from the city attorney. Please pay close attention to what was said Monday in council chambers.
