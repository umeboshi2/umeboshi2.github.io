Here is the resolution where we again levy and assess a tax on the city. It is exactly the same as the levy we performed a month earlier and voted to impose last week. Did we perform a tax levy on March 26? Did we vote to impose the levy we already made, as already written, or did we vote to impose another levy made on April 26?
