# Another Website

- [The Movie DB (tv shows)](#moviedb)

- [TV Maze API demo](#tvmaze)

This site is running:

- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) -
  Twitter Bootstrap is a very popular and useful css framework.

- [backbone.marionette](https://marionettejs.com/)
  Backbone provides models, collections and basic views.  Marionette 
  helps make view layout and management much easier.
  
- [tbirds](https://github.com/umeboshi2/tbirds/)
  Tbirds is the simple framework I created specifically for creating
  single page applications using bootstrap and backbone.marionette.
