## ELIZA

Eliza is a very old program that simulates a conversation, created 
to "demonstrate that the communication between man and machine 
was superficial" ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)).  The 
[elizabot](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) javascript implementation is 
being used in this demo.
